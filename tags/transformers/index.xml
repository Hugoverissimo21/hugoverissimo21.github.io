The goal was to develop a model capable of classifying the sentiment of these phrases as positive, negative, or neutral, thus contributing to a better understanding of the emotional impact of financial information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The subset with 75% annotator agreement was used to ensure higher reliability of the labels. Of this dataset, 80% was used for training and 20% for testing, ensuring accurate performance evaluation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
