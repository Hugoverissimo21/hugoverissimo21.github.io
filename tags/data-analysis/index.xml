Using artificial intelligence tools, the project analyzes thousands of journalistic articles since the dawn of the digital era to discover patterns, trends, and relevant insights on any topic. The goal is to transform large volumes of journalistic information into useful and accessible knowledge, contributing to the strengthening of media literacy and a more critical understanding of the information ecosystem.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Quantitative Research @ JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.</title><link>https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/projects/jpm-quantitative-models/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/projects/jpm-quantitative-models/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project uses quantitative research methods, machine learning, and data analysis to solve challenges in the financial and energy sectors. The analysis focuses on developing pricing models for natural gas contracts, estimating loan default probabilities, and forecasting losses for banks. Techniques such as K-means clustering, machine learning methods, and time series decomposition were employed to provide actionable insights.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Development of a prototype pricing model for natural gas contracts, based on estimated prices for buying/selling on specific dates, gas injection/withdrawal rates in storage, and associated costs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Media Coverage Analysis of PSI-20 Companies</title><link>https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/projects/infomosaic/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/projects/infomosaic/</guid><description>&lt;p>The main goal of this project is to analyze media coverage of companies listed on the PSI-20 index.
