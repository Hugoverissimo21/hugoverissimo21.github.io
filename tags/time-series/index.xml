The main objective was to develop a robust and accurate forecasting model to support power grid management and strategic energy decision-making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several statistical time series methods were explored, including ARIMA, GARCH, ETS, and STLM, to model electricity consumption over time. Each model was properly tuned, where applicable, and statistically validated, then compared using error metrics such as RMSE and MAPE.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CPI Anomaly Detector</title><link>https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/projects/cpianomalies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugoverissimo21.github.io/projects/cpianomalies/</guid><description>&lt;p>This project aims to detect anomalies in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key indicator used to measure inflation and the cost of living. The motivation is to identify unexpected and significant changes in consumer prices to support the analysis of economic dynamics and strategic decision-making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Public data from over 200 countries was used to develop an adaptive, real-time (streaming) model capable of automatically detecting anomalies. The main model is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, with a focus on economic time series.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
