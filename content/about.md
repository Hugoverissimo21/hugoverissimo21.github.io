Hi, I’m Hugo Veríssimo, a 21-year-old Master's student in Data Science with a background in Applied Mathematics for Economics and Management. I’m passionate about transforming complex problems into structured, actionable solutions, whether through statistical modeling, machine learning, or full-stack development.

I enjoy building data-driven systems end-to-end, from data processing to deployment, often working with tools like Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Transformers, Spark, Flask), R, or MATLAB. My technical interests are grounded in a strong appreciation for clean, efficient execution.

Beyond data science, I have a deep interest in finance and economics, fields where I find analytical thinking especially rewarding and impactful. I've also had the opportunity to present academic work at national conferences, contribute to educational initiatives, and collaborate on open-source projects.

You can explore some of my projects here on the site, in the [Projects](/projects/) section, and if you're curious about my journey or interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/hugoverissimo21) or [email](mailto:hugoverissimo21@gmail.com).
