This project includes implementations and comparative tests in Python of nine important sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Timsort.

The main goal was to theoretically explore the operation, complexity, and stability of each algorithm, as well as to run empirical tests on random lists of various sizes and characteristics. Results were validated through performance analysis and charts.
