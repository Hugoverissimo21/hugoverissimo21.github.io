Creation and benchmarking of a rating prediction algorithm based on LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) for large volumes of data from the MovieLens dataset. The goal is to predict a user's rating for a specific movie, using advanced hashing techniques to optimize the search for similarities between users and movies.

The algorithm was implemented in a high-performance computing environment, executed via SSH with distributed jobs on Apache Spark. This approach enables analysis and recommendation on large-scale datasets, ranging from 100 thousand to 25 million ratings, demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of the system in big data contexts.
